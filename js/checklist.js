// Check list
// (done) 1. Add a search bar and search button when the page loads
// (done) 2. Add navigation at the bottom of the page
// (done) 3. Hide all but the first 10 students when the page loads.
// 4. When a user clicks on “2” in the pagination, students 11 through 20 are shown. When a user clicks “3”, students 21 through 30 are shown. And so on. When “6” is clicked 51 through 55 should be shown.
// 5. Add an event listener to the search button. When the user clicks on the button it should use the text in the search input to filter the results. Searching should be case insensitive. e.g. a search for “Susan” should return results for “susan” and “Susan".


// Extra Credit
//  1. Include simple animations when transitioning between pages.
//  2. As the user types in the search box, dynamically filter the student listings. In other words, after each letter is typed into the search box, display any listings that match .
//  3. If no matches are found, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
